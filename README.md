# NgRx Demo app

This app gives an example of what you get using [NgRx-Entity-Generator](https://github.com/briebug/ngrx-entity-generator) to generate NgRx files for your Angular app. It has a few components we wrote to use the CRUD functionality of NgRx.

For this example, we generated NgRx files for an entity called "Briebug". Be sure to visit the [NgRx-Entity-Generator](https://github.com/briebug/ngrx-entity-generator) repo for full documentation.
